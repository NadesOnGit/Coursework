Code of Conduct
1.	Attendance
•	If a team member fails to attend multiple lab sessions specifically Monday or fails to attend without telling another team member (this is flexible under the team’s discretion), they will receive a strike. If they receive three strikes they will be reported to higher ups.
2.	Punctuality
•	If a group member is late more than 2 times (30 minutes), they owe every member a coffee (or beverage of their choice)
3.	Contributions
•	If a member fails to contribute without seeking help within a reasonable time frame, they will no longer have a say on work assigned to them.
•	At the start of each section of the coursework, we decide each member’s work.
4.	Meeting deadlines
•	If you fail to meet your individual deadlines, you have less of a say of what part of the coursework you do as it can affect an integral part of the project.
5.	Support
•	Be there for one another. If someone requires help, try and support them.
